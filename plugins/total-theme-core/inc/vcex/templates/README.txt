If you wish to modify any of these shortcode templates via a child theme you can create a vcex_templates folder in your child theme, copy and paste the file from this folder into that one and then make your adjustments.

Just keep in mind as with any theme making child theme template modifications means you might need to check the files whenever a new theme or total theme core update is released for potential changes and bug fixes.

It's strongly recommended to use filters/action hooks instead (if available). If you have any concerns let us know via the ThemeForest comments or a support ticket so we can guide you in the right direction in terms of customizing a specific module. I will also consider adding new settings/hooks to make customizations easier, don't be afraid to ask!
